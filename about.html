          <br />Aparigraha Foundation is based on 3 A's of Lord Mahavira-<br /><br />

          encourage dialog and harmony with other faiths.<br />

          while staying detached from our possessions.<br />

          ‘Live and Let Live’.

        <p>
          To build entrepreneurs who make a significant difference in the quality of

        <h4>Our History</h4>
        <p>
          What began nearly twenty five years ago as a girl’s vision to offer
          education to few children has grown into the APARIGRAHA Foundation.
          Documented on 23rd September, 2021, APARIGRAHA Foundation was built upon the belief system
          that regardless of stature, each individual intellect has the power to
          explore its unique skills and abilities to experience satisfaction in
          whatever one pursues for in a well honoured and respectable living.
          Associating, influencing and exemplifying true innovation throughout the
          world, the Foundation provides an impact through a coalition of resilient
          and thoughtful volunteers and donors.
        </p>
